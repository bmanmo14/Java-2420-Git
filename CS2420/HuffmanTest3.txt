Col. Hans Landa: So who are your three handsome escorts?
Bridget von Hammersmark: I'm afraid neither three speak a word of German. They're friends of mine from Italy. This is the wonderful Italian stuntman, Enzo Gorlomi; a very talented cameraman, Antonio Margheriti; and Antonio's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.
Bridget von Hammersmark: Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.
Lt. Aldo Raine: Buongiorno.
Col. Hans Landa: Gentlemen, it's a pleasure; the friends of our cherished star, admired by all of us, this outright jewel of our culture, are naturally going to be under my personal protection for the duration of their stay.
Lt. Aldo Raine: Grazie.
Col. Hans Landa: Gorlomi? Am I pronouncing it correctly?
Lt. Aldo Raine: Si... er, corretto.
Col. Hans Landa: Gorla... lomi? Say it for me once please?
Lt. Aldo Raine: Gorlami.
Col. Hans Landa: I'm sorry, again?
Lt. Aldo Raine: Gorlami.
Col. Hans Landa: Once more?
Lt. Aldo Raine: Gorlami.
